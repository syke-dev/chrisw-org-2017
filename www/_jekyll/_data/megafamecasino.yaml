  poker:
    title: "Poker"
    what: "Built a multiplayer poker game over http."
    desc:
      - "Supports classic free-play rooms and single table tournament style rooms."
      - "Table configuration is entirely data-driven, which allowed us to build new game modes with minimal programming (such as heads-up)."
      - "All poker actions including chat are REST requests to the server running the room."
      - "The client gets game updates via polling. Ideally this would be changed to a push-based system, but don't have any issues with the current system to justify the work needed."
