  poker:

    what: "Built a multiplayer poker game over http."
    desc:
      - "Supports classic free-play rooms and single table tournament style rooms."

      - "The client gets game updates via polling. Ideally this would be changed to a push-based system, but don't have any issues with the current system to justify the work needed."
