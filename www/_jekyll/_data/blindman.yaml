                  It allows us to measure the rotation of the player's head.

                  It is used primarily to display the health of the player.
                  It is also used to display cool effects when the game is starting up and the player is dying."

        caption: "The user interface for the Unity game is there for testing and so that other players can see what it happening in the game.
                  The 5 white spheres represent the 5 vibration motors on the hat.
                  The player's avatar is the black cylinder in the middle.
                  Right now, the player is attacking, which is displayed via the yellow cone in front of the player.
                  The black dot approaching from the player's left is a zombie."

        caption: "There are five vibration motors attached to the inside of the hat.
                  When the player dons the hat, there will be three motors resting on the front of the player's head and two motors that will be on the back / sides of the player's head.
                  When zombies approach, the motor in the direction of the zombie will begin to vibrate.
                  The closer the zombie gets, the more the motor will vibrate.
                  If a zombie is positioned in-between two motors, the total power will be distributed between them.
                  This allows the player to perceive where the zombies are around him and how close they are to him."
